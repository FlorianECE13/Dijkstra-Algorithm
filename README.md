Its a simple implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm in Java Language using HashMaps and ArrayLists and a Graph.
There is one class for the Nodes , one for the Edges and one for the Graph that uses those Nodes and Edges.
Then there is the class of the Dijkstra algorithm in which happen the iterations for the algorithm, the finding of the minimum distance and the node (from the Unused Nodes) with the minimum distance.
It doesnt have a main method. Everyone can make one of their own and put the object that they want and whatever nodes and distances they want.
